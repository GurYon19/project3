Project 3 Guidelines: Implementation of Neural Networks for Object
Detection
This project is designed to extend neural network knowledge from image classification to object
detection, emphasizing transfer learning, architectural reasoning, and independent research. Students
are expected to go beyond course material, investigate unfamiliar concepts, and justify all design
decisions.
Part 1: Report on Classification Model Backbone (10 Points)
Backbone Architecture Selection
Aggregate the IDs of all group members and use the final digit of the digit-sum to select the backbone
architecture:
• 0–3: ResNet18
• 4–6: VGG16
• 7–9: MobileNet V3
Important: An incorrect digit-sum calculation will result in a 10-point deduction.
Example: id1 = 12345678, id2 = 87654321 Digit sum = 72 → 7 + 2 = 9 → MobileNet V3
Requirements
1. ID Calculation Documentation Clearly document the full digit summation process and the
resulting backbone choice.
2. Inference Demonstration Run inference using the pretrained backbone on several random
images and present the classification results.
3. Architecture Analysis Report Write a detailed report (minimum two pages) analyzing:
• The overall architecture of the selected model
• Key building blocks not covered in course lectures
• Design motivations behind these components
• Observed strengths and limitations from inference results
Use original research papers and additional resources.

Part 2: Single Class, Single Object Per Frame (40 Points)
Objective
Develop a basic object detection model for a dataset containing a single object class, where each
image contains exactly one object. This part introduces the transition from classification to detection
through transfer learning.
Background: Classification Backbone as a Detector
Pretrained classification models such as ResNet, VGG, and MobileNet are trained on large-scale datasets
(e.g. ImageNet) and learn rich hierarchical feature representations. In this part, you will leverage such
a model as a backbone, reusing its learned features while adapting the network to predict object
location instead of a class label. This approach reduces training cost and improves generalization when
data is limited.
Requirements
1. Model Construction Build an object detection model using:
• The selected pretrained backbone
• Only basic PyTorch building blocks (e.g. Conv2d, Linear, ReLU, pooling)
You must explain how the classification model is adapted for detection.
2. Bounding Box Representation Research and implement an axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)
representation suitable for a single-object scenario.
3. Loss Functions and Metrics Research and select appropriate loss function(s) and evaluation
metric(s) for this task. Justify your choices theoretically and practically.
4. Dataset Selection and Preparation Select a dataset suitable for single-class, single-object
detection (e.g. from Roboflow Public Datasets). Justify the dataset choice and describe how it is
split into training, validation, and test sets.
5. Model Training and Analysis Train the model and provide a detailed analysis of:
