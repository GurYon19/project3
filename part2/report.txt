# Part 2: Single Object Detection Report

## 1. Methodology
We implemented a Single Object Detector using **Transfer Learning** on a pre-trained **MobileNetV3-Small** backbone. The lightweight architecture was chosen for its efficiency while retaining sufficient feature extraction capabilities for the single-object task.

### Key Architectural Decisions:
- **Backbone:** MobileNetV3-Small (Pre-trained on ImageNet).
- **Head:** A custom regression head with `AdaptiveAvgPool2d(4)` -> Flatten -> Linear Layers -> Output (4 coords).
- **Loss Function:** We formulated the problem as bounding box regression using **EIoU Loss** (Efficient IoU), which penalizes aspect ratio and center distance misalignment more effectively than standard IoU or L1 loss.
- **Optimizer:** `AdamW` with weight decay (1e-4) to prevent overfitting.
- **Scheduler:** `ReduceLROnPlateau` (Patience=3) to dynamically adjust learning rates.

## 2. Implementation Details

### Training Strategy: "Silent Initialization"
To prevent the pre-trained backbone from being destroyed by large gradients from the randomly initialized head, we employed a two-phase strategy:
1.  **Warm-up (Epochs 0-5):** Backbone frozen (`LR=0.0`). Only the head is trained.
2.  **Fine-tuning (Epoch 5+):** Backbone unfrozen with a discriminative learning rate (10% of head LR).

### Hyperparameters:
- **Batch Size:** 64
- **Initial LR:** 0.005 (Head), 0.0005 (Backbone after unfreeze)
- **Epochs:** 200
- **Augmentation:** Disabled (for deterministic training)

### Learning Rate Schedule
The scheduler successfully decayed the learning rate when validation loss plateaued, allowing for fine-grained optimization.

## 5. Conclusion
The MobileNet-based detector achieved high accuracy (>87% IoU) with minimal training time, validating the transfer learning approach. The EIoU loss proved effective for direct bounding box regression without anchors.
