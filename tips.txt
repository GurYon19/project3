Project Overview & Phases

    The Backbone: You will be assigned a specific pre-trained model based on your ID (ResNet-18, VGG-16, or MobileNet V3). MobileNet is noted for being lightweight and efficient for edge devices.

    Part 1: Classification (10 pts):

        Download the pre-trained model using PyTorch.

        Run inference on sample images (e.g., input an image of a rabbit, get the label "rabbit").

        Write a 2-page deep-dive report on the architecture.

    Part 2: Single Object Detection (50 pts):

        Find a dataset with Ground Truth (bounding boxes) for a single class (e.g., only dogs).

        Modify the model "Head" to output bounding box coordinates instead of just a label.

        Perform Transfer Learning. You need to research how to define the loss function for this yourself.

    Part 3: Multi-Class & Multi-Object (40 pts):

        Detect up to 3 objects per frame of different types (e.g., two dogs and a cat).

        Update the loss function and metrics to handle multiple boxes and labels simultaneously.

Crucial Project Tips

    The "Real World" Rule: Your final video results must show real-world scenarios. Avoid "clean" videos (like a dog on a plain white background). If the video is too "engineered" or simple, your grade will be lowered.


    Don't Over-Personalize Part 3: Parts 2 and 3 are independent. Don't try to train Part 3 on top of Part 2; it’s usually better to start the training fresh for the multi-object phase.

    The "Scriptiada" Warning: Expect to write many small scripts for debugging and data prep that might end up in the trash. It’s part of the process.

    Save Your Work: Use checkpoints! Training can be heavy, and computers crash. Don't lose hours of work because of a power surge or a memory leak.

    The Report: It needs to be comprehensive. Include TensorBoard screenshots, explanations of your data augmentations, and your pre-processing steps.
